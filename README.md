## Description

A line is drawn from a point in the center of the canvas to a random point located inside an imaginary circle. Then a new line is drawn from the previous random point to a new random point, still located inside an imaginary circle.

The process is repeaded indefinitely and, using trigonometry and magic, a circle starts to form.

It is housed in a simple HTML page, with some essential CSS.
